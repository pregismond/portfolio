## [Visualizing Car Sales and Dealer Profits Using Snowflake Snowsight](https://github.com/pregismond/creating-visualizations-using-snowflake-snowsight)

*Nov 2024*

This project aimed to analyze car sales and dealer profits for SwiftAuto Traders by creating visualizations and presenting them as dashboards. The approach involved using Snowflake's Snowsight to create and analyze business intelligence (BI) dashboards. Additionally, a Streamlit app was provided to produce the same visualizations using Streamlit-in-Snowflake (SiS).

**Objectives:**
- Analyze historical trends in car sales for SwiftAuto Traders
- Provide insights on car sales and profits for each dealer

**Impact:**
- Identify key performance indicators (KPIs) such as profit and quantity sold
- Inform business decisions based on data-driven insights

**Skills:** Python (Programming Language) · Data Engineering · Snowflake · Data Visualization · Security · Streamlit · Problem Solving · Data Warehousing · Business Intelligence

## [Diabetes Prediction Using PySpark MLlib](https://github.com/pregismond/coursera-diabetes-prediction)

*Aug 2024*

This project sought to build a logistic regression classifier using the PySpark Machine learning library (MLLIB) and Python to classify between diabetic and non-diabetic patients. My approach was to build a machine learning model to accurately predict whether the patient possesses diabetes or not.

**Objectives:**
- Set up PySpark on the Google Colab environment
- Work with Spark DataFrames
- Clean and prepare data for analysis
- Build logistic regression model with PySpark machine learning library to classify between the diabetic and non-diabetic patients

**Impact:**
- Predict on a new set of data of being diabetic or not

**Skills:** Python (Programming Language) · Data Engineering · Apache Spark ML · PySpark · Machine Learning · Data Science · Problem Solving · Apache Spark

## [Waste Management Data Warehouse using PostgreSQL and Cognos Analytics](https://github.com/pregismond/introduction-to-data-warehousing)

*Jun 2024*

This project involved indentifying patterns in volume and location of waste collection across Brazil. My approach was to design a data warehouse and subsequent visual representation of the waste collected by truck type, city, station ID and month.

**Objectives:**
- Design a Data Warehouse
- Load data into Data Warehouse
- Write aggregation queries
- Create MQTs
- Create a Dashboard

**Impact:**
- Inform decisions on resource allocation and deployment
- Forecast needs for future resources

## [Traffic Flow Optimization with Airflow and Kafka](https://github.com/pregismond/etl-data-pipelines-with-shell-airflow-kafka)

*Apr 2024*

This project sought to improve traffic flow on national highways by analyzing road traffic data from various toll plazas. My approach was to consolidate the disparate data from different toll operators and IT systems into a single file and then create a data pipeline to continue collecting the streaming data into a database for future analysis. During the process, I encountered carriage return characters (^M) and provided two potential solutions.

**Objectives:**
- Create an ETL pipeline using an Airflow DAG
- Build a streaming ETL pipeline using Kafka

**Impact:**
- Identify source(s) of traffic congestion 
- Inform possible solutions

**Skills:** Extract, Transform, Load (ETL) · Python (Programming Language) · Apache Airflow · Data Engineering · Bash · MySQL · Problem Solving · Apache Kafka · Shell Script

## [Acquiring and Processing Information on the World's Largest Banks](https://github.com/pregismond/python-project-for-data-engineering)

*Mar 2024*

This project required the creation of a database wherein managers from London, Berlin and New Delhi could query the top 10 largest banks by market capitalization in their local currency. My approach was to compile the list of the top 10 largest banks ranked by market capitalization in billion USD and then transform and store it in USD, GBP, EUR and INR based on the provided exchange rate.

**Objectives:**
- Extract real-world data from a public website using Webscraping and Requests API in Python
- Transform the data as per the problem statement
- Load the data in the required file format as well as a SQLite database
- Query the database to retrieve filtered information from the table

**Impact:**
- Identify market capitalization of the top 10 banks in various currency

## [Build a Machine Learning Pipeline for Airfoil Noise Prediction](https://github.com/pregismond/build-ml-pipeline-airfoil-noise-prediction)

*Feb 2024*

This project aimed to identify the optimal angle of attack and flow direction for airfoil noise reduction. My approach was to Extract, Transform, Load (ETL) and construct ML pipelines on data from a series of aerodynamic and acoustic tests of airfoil blade sections conducted in an anechoic wind tunnel.

**Objectives:** 
- Clean the dataset
- Create a Machine Learning pipeline
- Evaluate the model's performance
- Persist it for future use

**Impact:** 
- Inform future airfoil development for noise reduction

## [Data Analysis using Spark](https://github.com/pregismond/data-analysis-using-spark)

*Jan 2024*

The project required the creation of a robust data pipeline capable of ingesting employee data in CSV format. For this I analyzed the data, implemented necessary transformations, and enabled the extraction of valuable insights from the processed data.

**Objectives:**
- Create a DataFrame from a CSV file
- Define a schema for the data
- Perform transformations and actions using Spark SQL

**Impact:**
- Help HR analyze employees by salary, age, department, name and employee number
